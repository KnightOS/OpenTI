# OpenTI (z80e core)

This is a binding of the [z80e](https://github.com/KnightOS/z80e), but compiled into JavaScript using emscripten. To make it easy to use, a OpenTI-like wrapper will be written around it. This will also be the holding place of the HTML-based TI emulator (and maybe even TI IDE, later!).
