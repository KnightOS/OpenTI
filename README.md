# OpenTI

An emulator for calculators with [KnightOS](https://github.com/KnightSoft/KnightOS) support. Namely:

* TI-73
* TI-83+
* TI-83+ SE
* TI-84+
* TI-84+ SE
* TI-84+ CSE

And all the variations on that theme. This is just a library, it's up to you to use it.

## Demo

Work in progress. You can load up demo.html in your favorite browser and play with the JS stuff in
the console. There's no LCD or keyboard emulation yet, so it's not very interactive at the moment.

## Contributing

Fork it and submit a pull request. Four spaces to an indent, opening brace on the same line.

## Licensing

OpenTI is distributed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/KnightSoft/kernel/blob/master/LICENSE).
